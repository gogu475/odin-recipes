   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>"Marseille is possibly the greatest city of the pizza: there are more than a hundred mobile pizza vans. The variety may not be that of Naples but the standard is unquestionably higher because, by Neapolitan standards, the pizza is <em>incorrect.</em> It is often closer to a tarte fine than to a 'real' pizza. Better always trumps real. This version is better" - Jonathan Meades</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>2kg sweet onions</li>
    <li>400g anchovies</li>
    <li>1 sheet pure butter puff pastry</li>
    <li>Black olives</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Cook the thinly sliced onions and half the anchovies at a very low heat for 2 hours till the onions are reduced and very soft and the anchovies have dissolved.</li>
    <li>Spread this mix on the pastry leaving a 1cm border. Brush the border with olive oil.</li>
    <li>Decorate the top with the rest of the anchovies and the pitted olives. Bake in a medium oven for 20-25 minutes.</li>
   </ol>
